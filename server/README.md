# Intro

This is an extremely basic server app to provide the simple endpoints required. No refinement or higher thought has been applied to it.

# Running the server

Run `npm i`, then `npm start` from the `/server` folder. The app will run at http://localhost:8080. Leave running to use with the FE app.

# Testing the 5 second refresh

Change the stock price file and restart the server. The selected sku in the UI should be refreshed automatically within the next five seconds.

_This app was created using Node v21.7.1 and npm v10.5.0._
